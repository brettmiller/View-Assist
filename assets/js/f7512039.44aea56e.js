At present, someone should be able to go through the wiki and/or Youtube videos and install the components necessary to create a device that will listen for wake word and then action and respond.  Next steps are underway for tying these devices into the View Assist system.  The first video for this was uploaded today with a few more to follow before the complete View Assist configuration series is complete.  We have some good folks beta testing VA on the Discord channel and it is fantastic to see them get their VA system running and the excitement that follows.
