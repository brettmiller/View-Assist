Nothing could be farther from the truth.  As it stands now, some major enhancements have been implemented.  Some of these include:\\n\\n    * Ability to control displays individually\\n    * Modes have been enabled as well as do not disturb\\n    * Ability to include voice only satellites both with onboard wake word (eg ESP32) and with HA handling the wake words (eg anything using Stream Assist)\\n    * Additional custom sentences for media playback, volume control, weather forecast, shopping list, setting alarms and reminders, and others\\n\\nThe delay in posting is due to the need to tighten things up and reduce the amount of effort required for users to implement and to better handle errors.  I have made a lot of progress on this front and hope that I will be able to release the enhanced version soon"},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/View-Assist/blog/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2021-08-26-welcome/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-26-welcome/index.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Welcome to the View Assist blog","date":"2021-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":0.03,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"dinki","title":"View Assist","url":"https://github.com/dinki/View-Assist","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2521542","key":"dinki"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Welcome","authors":["dinki"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"April Update","permalink":"/View-Assist/blog/april-update"},"nextItem":{"title":"MDX Blog Post","permalink":"/View-Assist/blog/mdx-blog-post"}},"content":"Welcome to the View Assist blog"},{"id":"mdx-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/View-Assist/blog/mdx-blog-post","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2021-08-01-mdx-blog-post.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-01-mdx-blog-post.mdx","title":"MDX Blog Post","description":"Blog posts support Docusaurus Markdown features, such as MDX.","date":"2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Docusaurus","permalink":"/View-Assist/blog/tags/docusaurus","description":"Docusaurus tag description"}],"readingTime":0.175,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"S\xe9bastien Lorber","title":"Docusaurus maintainer","url":"https://sebastienlorber.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/slorber.png","key":"slorber"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"mdx-blog-post","title":"MDX Blog Post","authors":["slorber"],"tags":["docusaurus"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Welcome","permalink":"/View-Assist/blog/welcome"}},"content":"Blog posts support [Docusaurus Markdown features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features), such as [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).\\n\\n:::tip\\n\\nUse the power of React to create interactive blog posts.\\n\\n```js\\n<button onClick={() => alert(\'button clicked!\')}>Click me!</button>\\n```\\n\\n<button onClick={() => alert(\'button clicked!\')}>Click me!</button>\\n\\n:::"}]}}')}}]);
