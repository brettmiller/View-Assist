The videos are really a means to provide additional context to the wiki.</p>
<p>If you haven't checked out the Youtube channel please take a look and, not to sound clich√©, like, subscribe, and comment as this will help draw a larger audience and perhaps some other contributors.</p>

<hr>
<p>All videos and wiki pages are now available for creating the Assist satellite devices using Stream Assist for wake word detection.  At present, someone should be able to go through the wiki and/or Youtube videos and install the components necessary to create a device that will listen for wake word and then action and respond.  Next steps are underway for tying these devices into the View Assist system.  The first video for this was uploaded today with a few more to follow before the complete View Assist configuration series is complete.  We have some good folks beta testing VA on the Discord channel and it is fantastic to see them get their VA system running and the excitement that follows.  More good stuff coming soon.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Decided that it may be wise to include some status updates as if you look at the file upload dates it appears that the project is not active.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  As it stands now, some major enhancements have been implemented.  Some of these include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to control displays individually</li>
<li>Modes have been enabled as well as do not disturb</li>
<li>Ability to include voice only satellites both with onboard wake word (eg ESP32) and with HA handling the wake words (eg anything using Stream Assist)</li>
<li>Additional custom sentences for media playback, volume control, weather forecast, shopping list, setting alarms and reminders, and others</li>
</ul>
<p>The delay in posting is due to the need to tighten things up and reduce the amount of effort required for users to implement and to better handle errors.  I have made a lot of progress on this front and hope that I will be able to release the enhanced version soon</p>]]></content>
